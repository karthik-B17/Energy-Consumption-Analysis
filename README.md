I designed the database schema, established foreign key relationships, and created an ER diagram to model the dataset. Using SQL queries, I performed general, comparative, trend, and ratio analyses to uncover insights such as:

Top energy-consuming and emitting countries 🌍

Correlation between GDP growth and energy consumption 📈

Emission-to-GDP and per capita energy ratios 🔍

Global and country-level trends in emissions, production, and population growth

This project demonstrates end-to-end SQL skills including database design, data import, query writing, and analytical reporting, helping to understand how economic power, energy use, and emissions are interrelated.
